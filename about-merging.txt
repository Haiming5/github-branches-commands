fast-forward merging: 
- master branch did not have any new commit sicne the moment we copy it to 
other branches. At the end, there are two ways for master branch to fast-forward merge 
with other feature branches. 
The first one is using git merge <feature branch>, this will copy 
all commits from feature branch to the master branch, result in as many 
extra branches from feature branch inside master branch.

The second one is git merge --squash <feature branch>, by doing so, master 
branch will only stage the latest commit from feature branch and we need to 
commit these new changes inside master branch ourselves. The differnce is 
that merge --squash will only combine all the newest states from feature branch, 
and therefore there will be only one new commit(latest commit from feature branch) 
appears in the master branch.
